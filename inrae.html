                        I did my 5th year internship at <b>INRAE</b>.
                        <br>
                        INRAE is <b>the french public research institute</b> working for the coherent and sustainable
                        development
                        of <b>agriculture, food and the environment</b>.
                        <br>
                        From February 7th 2022 to July 15th 2022, I updated the <b>exploitation method of the
                            of the LiDARs (light detection and ranging) of the Phénomobile</b>, a robot allowing <b>high
                            throughput
                            phenotyping</b>, and then I developed an <b>application of these
                            LiDARs on sunflower plots</b>.

                <h3>The Phénomobile</h3>

                        The Phenomobile is a robot ordered by INRAE used to study plants in a field.
                        It travels autonomously through the plots and collects large scale information on the state of
                        the plants thanks to on-board sensors:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- 3 LiDARs Sick LMS400 allowing the acquisition of three point clouds of a
                            plot</li>
                        <li>- 3 Baumer VLG40C RGB cameras to acquire several colour images of a plot
                            of a plot</li>
                        <li>- 2 Airphen V3 multispectral cameras to acquire multiple multispectral images of a
                            multispectral images of a plot</li>
                        <li>- 5 LUMIX FR60 Flashes to control the lighting during an acquisition</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        With the technology it possesses, this autonomous robot allows for a fine and unambiguous
                        characterisation of the microplots of an experimental platform.

                <h3>Goals of the internship</h3>
                <div class="column-paragraph">
                    <p>
                        The three LiDARs of the Phenomobile are used to acquire point clouds
                        on crop canopies in the field.
                        The objective of my internship is to propose methods of exploitation of these point clouds
                        through 2 steps:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- The global registration of three point clouds in the same reference frame. Thus, we will
                            have
                            the information contained in the three point clouds in a single cloud
                            . This one will be denser, which will allow us to have more details on
                            plants.</li>
                        <li>- Cloud segmentation to isolate plant organs in the case of
                            sunflower.
                            During the internship I started with a first organ of the sunflower which seemed to be the
                            easiest
                            to detect, the capitulum (the sunflower flower head) on sunflower plots to be able to
                            calculate the diameter of each of the
                            capitula.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
