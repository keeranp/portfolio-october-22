                    I did my 4th year internship at <b>H3Dynamics</b>.
                    H3Dynamics is a Singaporean group leader in the field of cloud robotics and fully autonomous
                    drones.
                    This company offers an <b>autonomous building inspection service</b>.
                    I joined the department responsible for this service from September 7th 2020 to February 12th
                    2021.
                    I worked on several different projects during these 6 months of internship.
                </p>

            <h3>Automatic hiding of windows</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    <img src="assets/img/labelling.png" style="float: left; max-width: 200px;">
                    The goal of one of my projects was to be able to <b>automatically hide the windows of a
                        building</b> in
                    order to respect the privacy of its residents.
                    I first wrote a program to automatically detect windows on an image using <b>computer
                        vision</b>.
                    Then I had to code the part that automatically draws a black rectangle on these windows.
                    <img src="assets/img/masked.png" style="float: left;max-width:600px;">
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Metadata extraction</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    <img src="assets/img/rgbthermal.png" style="float: right;">
                    I made a program in <b>Java</b> to <b>retrieve the metadata of images taken by drones</b> to store
                    them in a <b>JSON</b>
                    file.
                    These drones take normal images and thermal images.
                    These images are not sorted and therefore we cannot know which normal images correspond to
                    their
                    thermal images.
                    With the metadata of these images, I added to the <b>Java</b> program a functionality to <b>group
                        the
                        "color"
                        images with the thermal images</b> that correspond to them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Smaller projects throughout the internship</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    During the internship, I created <b>REST APIs</b> with <b>Node.JS</b> and <b>explained their
                        functioning</b> so that my
                    colleagues could easily use these previously created programs.
                    I also wrote <b>Python</b> scripts to be able to do Data Cleaning on <b>JSON</b> files.
                    For most of the projects I did, most of the time there was no resource to help me on the
                    internet
                    like for example with the normal and thermal image grouping.
                    These projects were more difficult but it helped me improve my <b>problem solving skills</b>.
                </p>

            <h3>Working in Singapore</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Singapore is a multicultural city-state as there are three different ethnicities living there
                    (Chinese, Malay and Tamil).
                    The language that is most spoken is English.
                    English has been chosen to unite these communities.
                    Thus, the working language is English.
                    I already had a good knowledge of <b>English</b> but during this internship I was able to acquire a
                    <b>practical knowledge</b> of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this internship I learned to <b>adapt to a new culture</b> by working with people from
                    different
                    cultures.
                    Working with these people allowed me to learn more about <b>teamwork</b> and how to interact with
                    them.
